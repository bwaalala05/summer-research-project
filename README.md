1. Personal Notes

- LA2: linear algebra (inner-product spaces, operators on inner-product spaces, matrix decompositions, SVD, generalised inverses and pseudoinverses)
- MVS: Multiple linear regression, ridge and lasso)

All $\LaTeX$ files needs to be saved in the same directory as the files "preamble.tex", "macros.tex", "letterfonts.tex" to compile. Change "preamble.tex" to "preamble2.tex" for report.
